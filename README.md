# Smeargle Moves Snapshot

Prior to January 9th, 2025, the list of moves that Smeargle could copy from other Pokemon was included in the client-side Game Master file. This repo outlines which moves were on the last revision of the list before it was moved server-side, as well as moves which were *not* on the list (and therefore not able to be copied).
